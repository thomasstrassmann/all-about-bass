            <h2>Welcome to All about Bass - The resource for the four string phenomenon!</h2>
            <p> What makes the electric bass so special and why is it worth taking a close look at one of the most underrated 
                instruments in the world?</p> 
            <p> The bass is a real enigma:
                It can be the most boring instrument in the world, as well as the most exciting. 
                In which hands the bass is ultimately decides whether the listeners start yawning or can't get out 
                of their amazement.</p>
             
            <div id="introduction-img-container">
                <!-- Image by Jan Kopriva, source: https://www.pexels.com/de-de/foto/person-die-gitarre-spielt-3858086/ -->    
                <img src="./assets/images/introduction-bass.jpg" alt="a man playing the bass with normal picking technique">
            </div>    
            <p>And although the bass has (mostly) only four strings, it is the most versatile instrument in the world. 
                Because no other instrument is able to combine rhythm and melody in such a way. Whether playing wonderful melodies, 
                chords, or more rhythmic percussion parts (especially in funk), everything is possible. 
                Thus, the bass acts as a link (especially in larger bands) between the rhythm and melody group. 
                In one part the bass can rather nestle up to the guitar and the piano and in the next part it can offer 
                the drummer energetic support with dead-notes.</p>           

                
            <p>And this versatility is shown by the best bass players in the world, in different eras 
                since the 1930s. On the following pages you will learn how the bass became what it is today, 
                as well as find the most influential bassists across different genres and hopefully even new ideas for your own playing.
