### Introduction 
This website is about one of my biggest passions: playing bass. IÂ´ve been a bass player for over 20 years now and because of that it made sense to me to do a project about it.
What should this page achieve? 
Well, on the one hand it should infect people with my enthusiasm for this instrument - people who have little or no connection to the instrument in this case. 
On the other hand, visitors who are already interested in the subject, or who are passionate bass players themselves, should find a platform that informs about the history of the development of the electric bass and create new incentives to play.
So sum up this brief introduction: This is a webpage about bass, that is catchy to new interested people, but also filled with content, that could be relevant to a professional bass player.
